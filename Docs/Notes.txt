JIRA Issue: ESRI-89 Export Map Service Query to Shapefile GPTool

May allow output to File or Personal Geodatabase too.   File or Personal will be an older version (e.g. 9.3).   That will allow any older ArcGIS Desktop Client to access it.

Security reasons I will need to limit what servers the service can be used against.   I do not want to allow the user to potentially attack other servers using my tools as a proxy.   

Shapefile do not support null values.   They come in as None from JSON and you have to force them to some default value for int, date, etc.
