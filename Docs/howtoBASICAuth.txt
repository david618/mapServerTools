Tried using ArcGIS tokens; however, this was difficult
- Every time we published a service we had to set it's permission using arcgismanager
- Getting a token for an ip was difficult with multiple proxies

We are now using http basic authentication

1) Added user to {Tomcat}/conf/tomcat-users.xml

e.g.
  <role rolename="dvofusers"/>      
  <user username="dvof" password="*****" roles="dvofusers"/>

2) Added Security Constaint to ArcGIS Services {Tomcat}/webapps/arcgis/services/WEB-INF/web.xml 

   <security-constraint>
        <display-name>Constraint1</display-name>
        <web-resource-collection>
            <web-resource-name>dvof</web-resource-name>
            <description/>
	    <url-pattern>/dvof/*</url-pattern>
            <http-method>GET</http-method>
            <http-method>POST</http-method>
            <http-method>HEAD</http-method>
            <http-method>PUT</http-method>
            <http-method>OPTIONS</http-method>
            <http-method>TRACE</http-method>
            <http-method>DELETE</http-method>
        </web-resource-collection>
        <auth-constraint>
            <description>dvofusers</description>
            <role-name>dvofusers</role-name>
            </auth-constraint>
        </security-constraint>
    <login-config>
        <auth-method>BASIC</auth-method>
	<realm-name>ArcGIS Server Authentication</realm-name>
    </login-config>
    <security-role>
        <description/>
        <role-name>dvofusers</role-name>
    </security-role>
	
3. Added Security Constaint to ArcGIS Rest {Tomcat}/webapps/arcgis/rest/WEB-INF/web.xml 

   <security-constraint>
        <display-name>Constraint1</display-name>
        <web-resource-collection>
            <web-resource-name>dvof</web-resource-name>
            <description/>
	    <url-pattern>/services/dvof/*</url-pattern>
            <http-method>GET</http-method>
            <http-method>POST</http-method>
            <http-method>HEAD</http-method>
            <http-method>PUT</http-method>
            <http-method>OPTIONS</http-method>
            <http-method>TRACE</http-method>
            <http-method>DELETE</http-method>
        </web-resource-collection>
        <auth-constraint>
            <description>dvofusers</description>
            <role-name>dvofusers</role-name>
            </auth-constraint>
        </security-constraint>
    <login-config>
        <auth-method>BASIC</auth-method>
	<realm-name>ArcGIS Server Authentication</realm-name>
    </login-config>
    <security-role>
        <description/>
        <role-name>dvofusers</role-name>
    </security-role>
	

4. Added lines to python to do HTTP Basic Auth

import base64

# Create Configuration Variables
username = "dvof"
password = "*****"

# Add Authorization to header of req
base64string = base64.encodestring('%s:%s' % (username, password))[:-1]
authheader =  "Basic %s" % base64string
req.add_header("Authorization", authheader)
