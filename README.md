### mapServerTools

ArcGIS Server GP Service for Exporting Map Service data to Shapefile or File GeoDatabase.

Shapefile do not support null values.   They come in as None from JSON and you have to force them to some default value for int, date, etc. [Geoprocessing considerations for shapefile output](http://help.arcgis.com/en/arcgisdesktop/10.0/help/index.html#//002t0000000m000000.htm)

NOTE: This tool hasn't been updated for couple of years.  Last update was back at ArcGIS 10.1.
